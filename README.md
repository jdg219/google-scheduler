# Google Scheduler

The code here is a simple app to provide the user a way to easily specify and schedule a series of events
as tasks in Google.

## Quickstart


### Brief Notes to be expanded upon

- need to specify a start_date user input for each treatment
- user_inputs_results in main app handles all the user's choices and has the required start_date_input and time_events fields
- need to work on the custom option some more
- currently only works to manually specify pythonpath and run
- need to better represent outputs and check if any are even missing
  - updates to the gcal_function
- eventual update of task feature?
- work on actually packaging
